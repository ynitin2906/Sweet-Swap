#SWEET-SWAP
Sweet Swap teaches us Patience, Persistence & Focus: the 3 skills required to succeed in the game as well as in the workplace. A move made in the beginning might eventually help you create your high score.
In the game, players swap colored pieces of sweets on a game board to make a match of three of the same color, eliminating those sweets from the board and replacing them with new ones, which could potentially create further matches.
